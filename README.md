# Kalman filter implementation with with DBSCAN clustering on 3d radar sensor

This repository demonstrates a sophisticated implementation of object tracking using a 3D radar sensor. By integrating a Kalman filter and DBSCAN clustering, this code provides a comprehensive solution for accurate and robust detection and tracking of objects in three-dimensional space.
